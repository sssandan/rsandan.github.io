Hello! I’m Ryan. I go to Orange Coast College aiming to transfer to a UC or Cal State for computer science in the fall of 2020. My dream is to work and travel for the NBA alongside a team doing something Computer Science related like a data scientist or statistician. Right now I’m looking for a company where I can apply what I learn in the classroom into applications that matter and make a difference. I'm looking for an internship that can refine my skills, as well as teach me new ones.
