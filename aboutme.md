Hello! I’m Ryan. I go to Orange Coast College aiming to transfer to a UC or Cal State for computer science in the fall of 2020. My dream is to work and travel for the NBA alongside a team doing something Computer Science related like a data scientist or statistician. Right now I’m looking for a company where I can apply what I learn in the classroom into applications that matter and make a difference. I'm looking for an internship that can refine my skills, as well as teach me new ones.

*Some quick things I'm up to:*
- I currently work as an Instructor at [Mathnasium](https://www.mathnasium.com/lagunaniguel/our-team)
- I work as the Assistant Coach for [UCI's Men's Basketball Club](https://www.campusrec.uci.edu/club/basketball-men.asp)
- competing in a program called NCAS, trying to land this [NASA onsite experience](https://nas.okstate.edu/ncas/) in the summer of 2020. (update December 2019: LANDED IT!)
