<center> <h2>Hello! I’m Ryan.</h2> <p>I go to Orange Coast College aiming to transfer to a UC or Cal State for computer science in the fall of 2020. My dream is to work and travel for the NBA alongside a team doing something Computer Science related like a data scientist or statistician. Right now I’m looking for a company where I can apply what I learn in the classroom into applications that matter and make a difference. I'm looking for an internship that can refine my skills, as well as teach me new ones.</p> </center>

Here are some videos to highlight my career dream:
- [The NBA Data Scientist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpLHMKTolVw)
- [The Math Behind Basketball's Wildest Moves (TED Talk)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66ko_cWSHBU&t=3s)
