Hello! Thank you for visiting my website! My name is Ryan Sandan and these are my two brothers James and Mark (I'm in the middle hehe).
I'm 20 years old and I go to Orange Coast College for Computer Science. 
My dream is to work and travel for the NBA alongside a professional team preferably the Warriors doing something computer-science related. Click [here](sssandan.github.io/more-about-me) to know more about me!



What I'm currently doing: 
Taking 3 classes over the summer (Data Structures, Intro to Linear Algebra/Differential Equations, and Public Speaking), working @ Mathnasium, and making time for friends/family since it is summer after all! Also planning to finish [my side projects](sssandan.github.io/projectsandskills) and website over the summer :-)
