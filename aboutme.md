![me](https://bit.ly/2QHwpex)

My name is Ryan Sandan. These are my two brothers James and Mark (I'm in the middle hehe). 
I'm 20 years old and I go to Orange Coast College for Computer Science. 
My dream is to work and travel for the NBA alongside a professional team preferably the Warriors doing something computer-science related. 



What I'm currently doing: 
Taking 2 classes over the summer, working, and making time for friends/family! Also planning to finish my side projects and website over the summer :-)
