[Five your way](https://github.com/sssandan/findyourway) - In python, I learned a lot about dictionaries and parsing. By utilizing MapQuest's API, I created a program that can give 5 things (given at least two addresses):
- directions
- latitude/longitude
- total time
- total distance
- elevation 

[GPA Calculator](https://github.com/sssandan/GPA-Calculator) - Using BlueJ (java ide), I created a program that can calculator your Grade Point Average given the letter grade and the amount of units for each grade. You can read more about it by clicking the link~
