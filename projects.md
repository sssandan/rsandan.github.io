[findyourway](https://github.com/sssandan/findyourway) - In python, I learned a lot about dictionaries and parsing. By utilizing MapQuest's API, I created a program that can give 5 things (given at least two addresses):
- Directions
- Latitude and Longitude
- Total Time
- Total Distance
- Elevation 

(Currently working on a GUI application for it.)

[GPA Calculator](https://github.com/sssandan/GPA-Calculator) - Using BlueJ (java ide), I created a program that can calculator your Grade Point Average given the letter grade and the amount of units for each grade. You can read more about it by clicking the link~

[NBA Quiz](https://github.com/sssandan/NBA-Quiz) - Test your NBA knowledge! How well do you know the players? The history? Come find out! Using XCode 10 and learning swift through an iOS course in Udemy (Angela Yu and London App Brewery) This course is awesome because I'm learning a ton of things at my own pace. I learned about:
- Swift 
- The basics of XCode
- the MVC (model-view-controller) pattern for designing apps
- Labeling and views
- class initialisation
- Data encapsulation

I still want to change some things about it. For example, I want to add an option to choose between categories (NBA Players, Playoffs, Regular Season, etc).
